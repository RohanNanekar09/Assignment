# Assignment

Overview:
Built a fully modular ROS2 navigation pipeline for the Testbed-T1.0.0 robot by directly orchestrating individual Nav2 plugins — completely bypassing nav2_bringup. Each component was manually instantiated, parameterized, and lifecycle-managed giving full control over the navigation stack.

Environment Setup:
- Original system was configured with ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo (Ignition)
- Nav2 stack and assignment dependencies required ROS2 Humble with Gazebo Classic
- To resolve version incompatibility, a Docker-based environment was set up
- Inside Docker, ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Classic were installed and configured for simulation and navigation

Architecture:
Three independently managed subsystems each with their own launch file and lifecycle manager:
-Map Loading — Serves occupancy grid with transient local QoS ensuring late-joining nodes always receive the map.
-Localization — AMCL configured with tuned particle filter parameters. Initial pose automatically injected at robot's known spawn position — no manual RViz2 intervention needed.
-Navigation Stack — Six plugins manually configured:
  planner_server — Global path planning via NavfnPlanner
  controller_server — Local trajectory execution via DWB with 6 tuned critics
  bt_navigator — Behavior tree orchestration with replanning and recovery
  behavior_server — Spin, BackUp and Wait recovery behaviors
  velocity_smoother — Enforces acceleration limits before commands reach hardware

Master Launch Orchestration:
Single command launches the entire pipeline in a time-synchronized sequence:
t = 0s  → Map server starts
t = 3s  → AMCL starts and receives map
t = 6s  → Initial pose injected, map→odom transform established
t = 10s → Navigation stack starts with all transforms ready

Challenges:
-Configured Docker environment with X11 forwarding and DDS networking for ROS2 Humble + Gazebo Classic compatibility
-AMCL requires initial pose to publish map→odom transform — solved via automatic pose injection in launch file
-DWB controller generating only rotational velocity — fixed by adding missing sim_time, min_speed_xy and sampling parameters
-Velocity smoother publishing to /cmd_vel_smoothed but robot expecting /cmd_vel — fixed via topic remapping
-Lifecycle node race conditions on startup — resolved using TimerAction delays in master launch file
